# Deep-Learning-Project

This project was part of my cursus in Data Science Engineering at the University of Li√®ge.

In this project, we built an English to French machine translator using Recurrent Neural Networks with an Encoder-Decoder architecture.
Due to a lack of computational power, we had to limit ourselves to a very reduced dataset for training.
For this reason, our model is only capable of translating very simple and short sentences.
